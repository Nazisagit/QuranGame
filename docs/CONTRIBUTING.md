Guidelines on how to contribute to this project.

# Branching
Always create a branch for every new feature, or bug fix.  
All new branches are to be made from `master`

## Feature branches
### Style: `feature/feature_name`
### Example: `feature/login_button`

## Bug fix branches
### Style: `bug/bug_name`
### Example: `bug/khalil_exists`

# Merging
## Merging branches into `dev`
Only after a peer review may a branch be merged into `dev`  
by the reviewer.  

## Merging `dev` into `master`
We should be doing this weekly, or as often as we can.  
Small team, not worth putting so much pressure on us, lol.  
We should all come to an agreement before doing this.

# Rollback
Avoid as best as we can in all circumstances.  
Do only as last resort.  
Everyone must agree to it.
